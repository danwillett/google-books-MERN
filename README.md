# Google-Books-MERN

## Description

This MERN stack application utilizes the Google Books Api to allow users to search for and discover new books to read. By creating a user account, users can search books by a key word or author and be presented with book titles, pictures, and descriptions. If the user is interested in a book, they can save the book for later viewing. Users without an account, do not have the option to save books. This application aims to address the problem of finding an interesting, and then forgetting to borrow or buy the book later on.
